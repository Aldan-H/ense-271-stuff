Lab 1 Assignment Explanation:

    The general thought process was picturing an app for specific stores
(WalMart, SuperStore, etc.) and generalizing that idea into a single app
that can access any retail chain. I then pictured the process of navigating
an app like that, and what it would need to be efficient.
    I decided not to add the "Favorite Stores" list because while it was a
good idea to have, it did not feel like a required feature, which is why it
is in the unscheduled section.
    I tried colour coordinating the backbone and walking skeleton to make it
look more clean and easy to read.
    The Story cards under "Place order" are gray to help readability and keep
the asthetics fresher.
    The first release has all of the required functions for it to work properly,
and the second release has some extra features added on for quality of life.
